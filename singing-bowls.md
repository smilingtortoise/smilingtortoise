Every cell in our body is composed of energy that vibrates at its own unique rate.  There are many different effective sound therapies available, from the extremely personal and intimate primordial sound mediation to individually tuned chakra crystal bowls and gongs. These vibrational experiences harmonize your individual cells and blocked energy back into their healthy natural state of alignment with the Universal.   My passion and training have been in the traditional Himalayan singing bowls.  Training with internationally renowned expert Geoffrey Torkington has given me a firm foundation in the harmonization and performance of these beautiful traditional instruments.  I currently offer individual or group sound baths, ranging from 20-60 minutes including savasana enhancements.  This is an excellent addition to any restorative yoga class.  Please contact me to schedule your session.  Rates begin at $30 for a 20 minute individual session.

"Isabel was a presenter at our annual yoga retreat. She led some very blissed-out yogis through individual sound baths, and let us experiment with how sound vibration changes water. My personal experience was brilliant and illuminating. We’d have to sit down to coffee for me to explain fully how amazing it was.” -Sara Teal
